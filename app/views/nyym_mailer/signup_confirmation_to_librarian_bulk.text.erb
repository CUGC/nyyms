Mr. Library Man,

We've had a new registrant for NYYMS. Please send his teacher the appropriate music as soon as possible. Mailing details are below:

Students:
    <%= @young_men.map(&:pretty).map{|n| "  #{n}" }.join("\n\n") %>

Here's the teacher's address:
    <%= @registration.name %>
    <%= @registration.school_name %>
    <%= @registration.school_address %>

Thanks!
NYYMS Coordinator via nyyms.gleeclub.com
