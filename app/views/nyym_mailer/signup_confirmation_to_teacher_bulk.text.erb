Dear <%= @registration.name %>,

Your students have been successfully registered for New York Young Men Sing with the Cornell University Glee Club. You will receive a package in the mail soon with music for the following students:

<%= @young_men.map(&:pretty).join("\n\n") %>

The guest conductor, Prof. Jerry Blackstone, will assume that all participants know the music when they arrive on Saturday, so that he can spend rehearsal time fine-tuning pieces for performance, rather than going over notes.  Learning resources, such as MP3 files, will be available soon at http://nyyms.gleeclub.com/mp3s.

As a reminder, NYYMS will begin promptly at 9am on February 8th at Lincoln B20 at Cornell University. Please plan to arrive by 8:45 at the latest so that we can begin the day's events promptly at 9:00 a.m.  The concert is open to the public and begins at 3:30.

Should you have any questions, I encourage you to email me at nyyms@gleeclub.cornell.edu or call me at (203) 947-6132, and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

Thank you,

Donny Morrissey
New York Young Men Sing Coordinator
