Dear <%= @nyyms[0].teacher_name %>,
 
Your students have been successfully registered for New York Young Men Sing with the Cornell University Glee Club. You will receive a package in the mail soon with music for the following students:

<%= @nyyms.map { |nyym| nyym.name }.join("\n") %>
 
As a reminder, NYYMS will begin at 9am on November 17th at the Whalen Center for Music at Ithaca College. The concert is open to the public and begins at 3:30. Should you have any questions, I encourage you to email me at nyyms@gleeclub.cornell.edu or call me at (631) 741-4371 and I will get back to you as soon as possible.
 
Finally, it is assumed that all participants will have an understanding of the pieces before they arrive on Saturday so that the conductor has the ability to fine tune the pieces for performance and does not need to waste time going over notes.  Resources such as MP3 files to aid in this process will be available soon.
 
Thank you,
Michael Gross
New York Young Men Sing Coordinator
