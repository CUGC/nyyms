<p><strong>New York Young Men Sing</strong> is an annual event hosted by the Cornell University Glee Club, the menâ€™s choir at Cornell. Knowing that it can sometimes be difficult to be a male singer in high school, we host this event to encourage male students to continue singing not only through high school, but throughout their collegiate and adult lives. The students will arrive at Cornell University in the morning and spend the beginning of the day rehearsing with the Glee Club. After lunch, the students will be taught a song by The Hangovers, the a cappella subset of the Glee Club and then rehearse more with the full Glee Club. The afternoon will culminate with a concert in Sage Chapel showcasing the repertoire learned that day. Registration costs $30. If there are financial concerns, please contact us as scholarships are available.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please contact Nick Ringelberg '16, NYYMS Coordinator, at nyyms@gleeclub.cornell.edu</p>
